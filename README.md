# Subreddit Search Application

> A React application which takes a single subreddit tag from the user per submit and retrieves subreddit posts using the inputted tag. The results are displayed in descending order and 10 posts are shown at any one time, the pagination at the bottom of the page allows users to navigate through the results.
The list consists of the post title and below the title is the date and time the post was created. Each of the list items are linked to their respective urls and when clicked, the user will be redirected to the subreddit post.
